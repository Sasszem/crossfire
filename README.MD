# Crossfire

### Introduction
My goal is to recreate the game [Crossfire](https://seet.itch.io/crossfire), a bullett-dodging shooting-less shooter for windows.
The original game was featured in [The Best Games from GMTK Game Jam 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2ebZXQ_J8Q).
My secondary goal is to let this project be damn well documented - UML diagrams, class docs, git page, etc.
### Technical overview
