# Crossfire

### Introduction
My goal is to recreate the game [Crossfire](https://seet.itch.io/crossfire), a bullett-dodging shooting-less shooter for windows.
The original game was featured in [The Best Games from GMTK Game Jam 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2ebZXQ_J8Q).
My secondary goal is to let this project be damn well documented - UML diagrams, class docs, git page, etc.
### Technical overview
 - [LÃ–VE2D](https://love2d.org/) engine
 - [Moonscript](https://moonscript.org/)
 - [Nata](https://github.com/tesselode/nata/) [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)-lib
 - [Busted](https://olivinelabs.com/busted/) unittesting
 - Sadly, no documentation generator
(no docgen supports Moonscript)
